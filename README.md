# Smart_metering_privacy_framework

This repository relates to a simulation of a big data privacy framework relating to energy consumption of individual smart meters.

The Feature Engineering script makes the data engineering process transparent. The main goal here was to add weather and seasonality data (including holidays), and making all relevant data for future models numeric (binary | float). 

The Modelling 1.0 script illustrates the steps taken to make a predictive analysis for an individual smart meter.

The Modelling 2.0 script illustrates the steps taken for a predictive analysis at the cluster level.

The Exploratory script illustrates the steps taken for any statistical analysis within the present study.
